# Introduction to Python for Data Science

This is a set of notes used for teaching Python to students that have never used Python, or programmed in any language. In a usual semester, it takes approximately 4 weeks (meeting twice a week for an hour) to go through the material, for a freshmen undergraduate class. 

## Notes

* The notes are in the form of iPython notebooks and are stored under the `/notes` folder.
* If you are an NYU student, you can [use the NYU JupyterHub server](https://jupyterhub.stern.nyu.edu/) to access the Jupyter server and the notes (under `/notes/pi1/introduction-to-python`).
* If you do not have access to your own Jupyter server, you can interact with the notes by clicking the "[Launch Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipeirotis/introduction-to-python/master)" button.

## Exercises for `nbgrader` (for Educators)

* If you would like to get access to the autograded assignments that we have developed, please contact me at `panos@stern.nyu.edu`.


## Recommended Books

* [Python for Everybody: Exploring Data In Python 3](https://www.py4e.com/book): This is a textbook for students that are learning Python as their first programming language, with the objective of using programming to handle and analyze data. 
* [Automate the Boring Stuff using Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com): A task-driven textbook that teaches Python by focusing on how to automate various tasks, using programming.


## Additional Books for Learning Python

* [How To Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/toc.html#t-o-c): An interactive guide to programming and Python. The book "Python for Everybody" (listed above) is partially based on this book.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/): An introduction to programming and Python. It targets complete beginners. It used a drill-based approach for teaching, which can be tedious at times. Nevertheless, it is considered one of the standard textbooks for learning Python.

## Online Classes

* The following Coursera courses [Getting Started with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python), [Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data), [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data), [Using Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases), [Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-capstone) are well-alinged with the objectives of our class. 
* [Code Academy, Python class](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python): This is a useful interactive tutorial for beginners, who are trying to understand programming in general, and Python in particular
* [Googleâ€™s Python class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)

## Credits

* I ~~have stolen~~ relied heavily on the "Python for Everybody" and the "How To Think Like a Computer Scientist" books to develop the structure and the material for the notes. 
* The initial version of the notebooks came from Josh Attenberg, from his course "Practical Data Science" that was taught at NYU/Stern.
* Katherine Hoffmann contributed to the development of the current notebooks.
