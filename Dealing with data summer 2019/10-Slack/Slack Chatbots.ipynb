    "A chatbot is a service, powered by rules and sometimes artificial intelligence, that you interact with via a chat interface. The chatbots based on rules, tend to be limited in functionality, and are as smart as they are programmed to be. On the other end, chatbots that use artificial intelligence, understands language, not just commands, and continuously gets smarter as it learns from conversations it has with people. The service could be any number of things, ranging from functional to fun, and it could live in any major chat product (Slack, Facebook Messenger, Text Messages, etc.)\n",
