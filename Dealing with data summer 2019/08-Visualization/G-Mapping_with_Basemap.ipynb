    "* [**Seaborn**](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html) is a library for making attractive and informative statistical graphics in Python;\n",
    "* [**Bokeh**](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) targets modern web browsers for presentation; its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of novel graphics in the style of D3.js, but also deliver this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets;\n",
    "* [**plotly**](https://plot.ly) generates the most interactive graphs; allows saving them offline and create very rich web-based visualizations;\n",
    "* [**folium**](http://folium.readthedocs.org/en/latest) builds on the data wrangling strengths of the Python ecosystem and the mapping strengths of the [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com) JavaScript library;\n",
    "* [**ggplot**](http://ggplot.yhathq.com) is built for making profressional looking, plots quickly with minimal code;\n",
    "* [**pygal**](http://www.pygal.org/en/latest) features various graph types like bar charts, line charts, XY charts, pie charts, radar charts, dot charts, pyramid charts, funnel charts, gauge charts; is used for creating svg charts\n",

Find TOP 10 airports wich are situated on the greatest height and TOP 10 airports with the lowest altitude. Display the list of this airports showing its name and country. Also draw the map of Miller projection (`projection=\"mill\"`) using `shadedrelief()` method and show these airports using colored markers. The marker's color depends on the airport's altitude and can be defined with the help of `get_marker_color(altitude)` function which we have used earlier. Marker's size is 10 units.

    "> Find TOP 10 countries with the largest and the lowest amounts of airports on their territory and show all airports of these countries using markers on the `folium` map. Circle markers correspond to TOP 10 countries with the largest amount and diamond markers define TOP 10 countries with the lowest amount of airports. Red markers should denote the airports which have no connections with some others, i.e. thay are absent in `routes` DataFrames; blue markers correspond to all others. Marker's size is fixed and equals, for example, to 1000."
